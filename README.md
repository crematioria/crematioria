## hi, i'm pink.

i don't play a whole lot of ponytown and i'm not about to make a whole dni/byf for it but here's a few tips for success:

【☆】do not attempt to contact me offsite if you play exclusively on the safe server. minor or adult, doesn't matter

【☆】go ahead and take inspo from my skins if you want

【☆】no i will not rp with you

【☆】yes you can sit with me, c+h, int... have at me

【☆】i accept all friend and item requests (provided i'm not alr holding something i wanna keep)

my current fixation is mha and there's a 99.9% chance i'll be wearing a mha pony (most likely dabi) at any given moment as noted above: please do not attempt to rp with me if i don't know you, especially in a shipping capacity. this is ponytown. please. spare me

nothing else of note to say, but if you read alla that, feel free to shoot me friend req and say hi :-)
